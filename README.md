A collection of various classical pathfinding algorithms written in JS.  Includes A* (finally justifying the repo's namesake, after a several month delay), and also includes depth-first search and breadth-first search.

These are just plain vanilla-js files, with es6-leanings (they use stuff that only works chromium/firefox at the time of writing, though that will likely be universally supported in the near future).  They import lodash, jquery, and also do some canvas drawing to create a nice visual graph of the mazes being solved and of the nodes touched by the algorithm.

## Warning:
Most of the files are busted "partial attempts" to get the algorithms working.

Two files work:
`a_star_short.html`
`node_graph_and_breadth_first.html`

Disregard the rest.
